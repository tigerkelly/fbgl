# fbgl
Simple graphics library for linux framebuffer on the RPI

Framebuffer Graphics Library. (fbgl)

Basic shapes like circle, box, text and line.

This uses the freetype font library.

	sudo apt install -y libfreetype-dev libpng-dev

Also uses my utils library.

	git clone https://github.com/tigerkelly/utils.git

Place the utils library at the same level as the fbgl code.

The example directory contains a simple example.
